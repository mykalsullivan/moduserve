- Dynamic command loading
- Chat messages need to be stored on a SQL database...
- Config file loading (JSON)
- Connection handshake (ensuring correct protocol version, application version, name of program, etc)
- Introduce a signals/slots mechanism that will allow each subsystem to communicate with each other
    - Create a way to keep track of what subsystems are connected to what slots
- Add Windows support
- Allow the server to start as a daemon (but don't let the user start it as a daemon after it has already been started)
- The logger should allow you to specify the sender of the log message
- The server needs to be able to read custom subsystems as shared objects in a "custom_subsystems" directory
    - Same idea for a "custom_commands" directory
- Include the built-in subsystem headers in the subsystem API
- Combine UserAuthenticator and UserSubsystem, or remove them both, or allow the option to use authentication
- Commands need a more centralized way to be registered
- Simplify the Connection class by moving the functionality from some of the functions directly into the constuctor
- Include usage info on the Command class
- Allow the user to enable debug logging with a switch upon startup (server)
- Remove some of the unnecessary directories in "subsystems"
