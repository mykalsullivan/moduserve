- Dynamic command loading
- Config file loading (JSON)
- Connection handshake (ensuring correct protocol version, application version, name of program, etc)
- Allow the server to start as a daemon (but don't let the user start it as a daemon after it has already been started)
- The logger should allow you to specify the sender of the log message
- Combine UserAuthenticator and UserSubsystem, or remove them both, or allow the option to use authentication
- Allow the user to enable debug logging with a switch upon startup (server)
- When a connection is removed, there should be the option to give a reason WHY they are being removed
- Use EnTT for storing Connection info stuff
    - Decouples information from functionality
    - We would no longer need a derived ServerConnection class
    - Allows subsystems to add states to Connections (i.e. user information for each connection)
- registerSubsystem() and registerCommand() need to take a command class as a template argument instead of taking a pointer directly

- Move the registry inside NetworkEngine outside of it to be used globally (maybe)
- CHANGE THE NAME FROM XServer TO SOMETHING LESS, WELL, ALREADY USED AND BAD.

- Include usage info on the Command class
