### Priority ###
- Move the registry inside NetworkEngine outside of it to be used globally (maybe)
- Encapsulate messages in a Message object
- The logger should allow you to specify the sender of the log message
- Dynamic command loading

### Extra ###
- Allow the user to enable debug logging with a switch upon startup
- Combine UserAuthenticator and UserSubsystem, or remove them both, or allow the option to use authentication
- When a connection is removed, there should be the option to give a reason WHY they are being removed
- Kick users after a set amount of invalid commands
- Include usage info on the Command class
- Connection handshake (ensuring correct protocol version, application version, name of program, etc)
- Config file loading (JSON)
- Allow the server to start as a daemon (but don't let the user start it as a daemon after it has already been started)
