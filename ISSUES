- The Server class now uses a singleton. Unfortunately, this isn't implemented properly and needs extern to be used across the other translation units
- Command registration doesn't work
- The Server sub-services use std::barrier, which is not applicable since each sub-service isn't running on its own thread
    - Instead, a CV will have to do. Maybe create a SubService virtual class?
- I might remove the UserAuthenticator and UserManager classes out so that I can make the Server more abstract and extendable.
- The server port should be random if not specified by the user upon startup
- You can no longer specify the server port upon startup
- The logger needs to display which module is sending the log message
- After a client joins, the client fd blocks indefinitely. Please fix this for the third or fourth time.
